# EasyDAG: The Conversational BlockDAG Assistant

A submission for the BlockDAG Hackathon 2025.

## Overview

EasyDAG is a web application designed to make smart contract development on BlockDAG accessible to everyone. While blockchain technology can be complex for newcomers, our project significantly lowers this barrier with a dual-mode AI assistant. This allows both beginners and experts to generate, understand, and discuss smart contracts using natural language. 

---

## Key Highlights

#### Dual-Mode AI Assistance 
The contract generator can be switched between two convenient modes: 
* **Conversational Mode:** Chat with a friendly, knowledgeable AI powered by Google Gemini 1.5 Flash to ask questions about BlockDAG and smart contracts in plain English. 
* **Protocol Builder Mode:** Generate secure, ready-to-use smart contract templates using a clean, form-based interface with no coding experience required. 

#### Multi-Contract Support 
Build three essential contract types out-of-the-box: 
* ERC-20 Tokens 
* Staking Protocols 
* Vesting Contracts 

#### Interactive Community 
EasyDAG features a dynamic community forum where users can post questions, create blog entries, upvote or downvote posts, and collaborate with others.

#### Secure Wallet & Guest Authentication 
The user-friendly interface includes auto-expanding chat inputs, hover-to-preview contract templates, and dynamic forms that adapt to your choices for a clean, responsive experience.
